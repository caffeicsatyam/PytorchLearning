#                            PytorchLearning
# Learning Pytorch For GenAI :

**Day 1**: Tensors in Pytorch:
    > Learned about Tensors and Basics of Pytorch like :
                    - like datatypes , operators, operations, special 
                       functions

**Day 2**: Learned about Autograd:
    > A pytorch inbuilt function for derivatives and differentiations.
    > Built Simple Neural Network.

**Day 3**: Building Neural Netork:
    > Using a Knowledge previously learned Build a simple Neural Network
