# Learning Pytorch For GenAI :

**Day 1**: Tensors in Pytorch:
    > Learned about Tensors and Basics of Pytorch like :
                    - like datatypes , operators, operations, special 
                       functions

**Day 2**: Learned about Autograd:
    > A pytorch inbuilt function for derivatives and differentiations.
    > Built Simple Neural Network.

**Day 3.1**: Building Neural Netork:
    > Using a Knowledge previously learned Build a simple Neural Network
       
**Day 3.2**: Improving Previous NN:
    >  Improved Neural Network with Pytorch Built functions

**Day 4**: Dataset and Dataloaders in Pytorch:
    > Learned to proprocess the data for usable cases.
    >Improved the previous model with dataloader and datasets.

**Day 51**: Building ANN :
    > Built a fully functional GPU with Fashion MNIST DATASET.
    > Got almost 89% of accuracy on evaluation.

**Day 5.2** Building ANN with GPU:
    > ADDED GPU compatibility in pytorch for faster model training.
    > Improving results with some hyperparameters.

**Day 6** : Hyperparameter Tunning NN:
    > Tunned the pervious Neural Network with optuna

**Day 7** : Building a CNN with Pytorch:
    > Using CNN on fashion-MNIST dataset.
    > To check if it works better.
    > Acheived 92%  accuracy.
